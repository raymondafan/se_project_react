OVERVIEW
This project is a weather application built with React that utilizes React Router for navigation. It includes features like multiple routes, nested routing, dynamic routes, lifting state, global state with context, working with keys and lists, form handling with refs, pure components, and higher-order components (HOCs). Additionally, a mock server is used to simulate data retrieval from an API.
